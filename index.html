    <h2 class="h5">What is the Blue-Blazed Trail Running Series?</h2>
      <p>The Blue-Blazed Trail Running Series is a sequence of races in Connecticut that 
          are run entirely or in part on the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails (BBHT).  The BBHT 
          are maintained by the Connecticut Forest &amp; Park Association (CFPA). The goals of
          the series are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To promote and create greater awareness of trail running on the BBHT System</li>
        <li>Attract more runners to Connecticut trail running races</li>
        <li>Strengthen the running community</li>
        <li>Raise awareness for CFPA's trail maintenance efforts</li>
        <li>Enhance the experience for the runners who already support our races through series points and recognition</li>
        <li>Ohâ€¦and to have fun running in the woods!</li>
