  <h2>About the series</h2>
  <p>The Blue-Blazed Series offers a diverse selection of races for runners of all 
      skill levels. The Series brings greater awareness to the Blue-Blazed Hiking 
      Trails and the Connecticut Forest & Park Association (CFPA), whose volunteers 
      build and maintain the trails on which so many love to run.</p>
  <p>Runners earn points for each race they participate in. These points are tallied,
      and at the end of the series the top runners will receive a unique award in 
      recognition of their accomplishment.</p>
  <p>Participation is easy and automatic - register at each race in which you 
      participate and they will give the results to CFPA for posting.</p>

  <h2>Blue-Blazed Race Series Point System</h2>
  <p>The points are calculated as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Participants receive 3 points for finishing, plus an additional 1 point for winning their age group
      <ul>
        <li>Age Groups include: 0-9 / 10-18 / 19-29 / 30-39 / 40-49/ 50-59 / 60-69 / 70-79 / 80+</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Overall winners receive 2 additional points. Therefore, someone who takes part and wins their age group would receive 4 points; the overall race winner would receive 6 points allother competitors receive 3 points</li>
    <li>At the end of the series we will publish overall results and age group winners (M/F) for each age group as defined above.</li>
