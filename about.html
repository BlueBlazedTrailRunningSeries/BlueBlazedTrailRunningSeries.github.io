  <h2 class="h3">About the series</h2>
  <p>The Blue-Blazed Trail Running Series offers a diverse selection of races for 
      runners of all skill levels. The Series brings greater awareness to the 
      Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails and the Connecticut Forest &amp; Park Association 
      (CFPA), whose volunteers build and maintain the trails on which so many love to 
      run.</p>
  <p>Runners earn points for each race they participate in. These points are tallied,
      and at the end of the series the top runners in each category will receive a 
      unique award in recognition of their accomplishment.</p>
  <p>Participation is easy and automatic - register as you normally would at each 
      race in which you will participate and the race will give the results to BBTRS 
      for posting.</p>

  <h2 class="h3">New for 2022</h2>
  <p>To simplify the season, we have streamlined the race lineup.  However, don't 
      fret, all your favorites are still included for 2024! We have 12 race options included for 2024 with distances ranging from 10k to 50k. 
      Additionally, for events with multiple distance options, we have selected one 
      distance from each race event that will score you points in the BBTRS - please check which distance gets you points!. These 
      changes will make it easier to select the races to participate in.</p>

  <h2 class="h3">Blue-Blazed Trail Running Series Point System</h2>
  <p>The points are calculated as follows:</p>
  <p>Race winners receive 100 points. Subsequent finishers receive points equal to 
      the winner's time in minutes divided by their finish time.</p>
  <p class="mb-1">As an example:</p>
  <ul class="pl-3" style="list-style: none;">
    <li>The winner finishes a race in 24 minutes. They earn 100 points.</li>
    <li>Another runner finishes in 30 minutes. They earn 24/30 = 80 points.</li>
    <li>Another runner finishes in 32 minutes. They earn 24/32 = 75 points.</li>
  </ul>
