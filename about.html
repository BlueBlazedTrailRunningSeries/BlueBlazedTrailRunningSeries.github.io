  <h2 class="h3">About the series</h2>
  <p>The Blue-Blazed Series offers a diverse selection of races for runners of all 
      skill levels. The Series brings greater awareness to the Blue-Blazed Hiking 
      Trails and the Connecticut Forest &amp; Park Association (CFPA), whose volunteers 
      build and maintain the trails on which so many love to run.</p>
  <p>Runners earn points for each race they participate in. These points are tallied,
      and at the end of the series the top runners will receive a unique award in 
      recognition of their accomplishment.</p>
  <p>Participation is easy and automatic - register as you normally would at each 
      race in which you will participate and the race will give the results to CFPA 
      for posting.</p>

  <h2 class="h3">Blue-Blazed Race Series Point System</h2>
  <p>The points are calculated as follows:</p>
  <p>Race winners receive 100 points. Subsequent finishers receive points equal to 
      the winner's time in minutes divided by their finish time.</p>
  <p class="mb-1">As an example:</p>
  <ul class="pl-3" style="list-style: none;">
    <li>The winner finishes a race in 24 minutes. They earn 100 points.</li>
    <li>Another runner finishes in 30 minutes. They earn 24/30 = 80 points.</li>
    <li>Another runner finishes in 32 minutes. They earn 24/32 = 75 points.</li>
  </ul>
